### For any of these scripts to work you need to add the Tampermonkey extension to your browser:<br>https://www.tampermonkey.net<br>
Once you have Tampermonkey installed, clicking on any of the links below will redirect you to a page where you can install that script with one click.<br>
If you don't have Tampermonkey installed when clicking a link, your device will try to save the script as a file instead.

### Pxls Stack Timer<br>
https://github.com/TheWaffleLord37/Pxls-Tampermonkey-Scripts/raw/main/Pxls%20Stack%20Timer.user.js<br>
(Adds a timer below your stored pixels if you have more than one pixel that shows how long until you receive your next pixel. The timer is usually green but if it's red instead, that means it's better to wait to receive your next pixel instead of placing one right away. (Warning: this is not 100% accurate, it might be off by a few seconds.))

### Pxls Undo Timer<br>
https://github.com/TheWaffleLord37/Pxls-Tampermonkey-Scripts/raw/main/Pxls%20Undo%20Timer.user.js<br>
(Adds a 60 second timer under your stored pixels that appears whenever you undo a pixel. (Warning: This timer appears even if you still have 1 or 2 undos left before you have to wait 60 seconds for the next 3.) (Another warning: this is not 100% accurate, it might be off by a few seconds.))

https://github.com/TheWaffleLord37/Pxls-Tampermonkey-Scripts/raw/main/Pxls%20Milestone%20Alerts.user.js<br>

(If the color brightness setting is turned on and below 100%, this script sets color brightness to 100% when heatmap is toggled on. Intended to fix the issue of heatmap being too dark when color brightness setting is below 100%.)
